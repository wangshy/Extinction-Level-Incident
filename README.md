# Extinction-Level-Incident
Extinction-Level-Incident(ELI) is a small JApplet game just for fun. Eliminate the meteors by hitting on them with your mouse to save the world. 

When you get 10 meteors, you will win a nuclear bomb which you can use to erase all the meteors on screen. However, the game will evolve with more difficulty if you have used the nuclear bomb.
